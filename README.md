# A reasonable Emacs config
## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.
